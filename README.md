# Battlecode 2020 - Bowl of Chowder

This is the repository for team Bowl Of Chowder in MIT Battlecode 2020.

I made finals and achieved 6th - 5th place!

I wrote a **postmortem** about Battlecode and my bot here: https://stonet2000.github.io/battlecode/2020/

I'm also writing an article from a more sentimental perspective about Battlecode and life, to be published soon on Medium and linked here.

Check out https://www.battlecode.org/ for more information about Battlecode!

As other teams post their postmortems I'll also link them here:

## Code

`src/ChowQualifiersFinalBot.zip` is a zipped up folder of my **qualifiers** bot

`src/FinalChowBot.zip` is a zipped up folder of **finals** bot

`src/Chow7` is somewhere in between seeding tournament and qualifiers tournament as I transitioned between a pure turtle strategy to my cookie/passive lattice strategy. This seeding bot ranked 3rd in seeding tournament.

the `oldbots` folder contains a lot of old code of previous iterations of my bot.

Also disclaimer: This was all written in 22 days and in the middle of my midterms and school work, so expect a lot of spaghetti code and bad practices.

## Past Bots

My past teams and bot source code:

[Codelympians (2019)](https://github.com/StoneT2000/BC19): 12th - 9th

Codelympians (2018): Couldn't find original code, also not sure what ranking we were
