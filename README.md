# Battlecode 2020 - Bowl of Chowder

This the repository for team Bowl Of Chowder in MIT Battlecode 2020.

I made finals and achieved 6th - 5th place!

I wrote a postmortem about Battlecode and my bot here: https://stonet2000.github.io/battlecode/2020/

I'm also writing an article from a more sentimental perspective about Battlecode and life, to be published soon on Medium and linked here.

Check out https://www.battlecode.org/ for more information about Battlecode!

As other teams post their postmortems I'll also link them here:
